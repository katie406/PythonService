# PythonService
A Python Script that runs a Windows Service 
Install by: python test.py install
Delete service by: sc delete [Service Name]
Please note: The service will continually try to stop, the only way I have found to fully stop the service is to restart the pc. 
The python debugger was very helpful to me: python test.py debug

These links were very helpful and I used some of their code:
